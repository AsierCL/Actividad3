# Vector sorting program

This code corresponds to an experimental program in which the three most famous sorting algorithms are evaluated (quicksort, bubble sort, selection sort).



## Usage/Examples

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/AsierCL/Printer-Management-Application.git
  cd Printer-Management-Application/
  make
  ./programa
```

- You must choose the sorting algorithm to use
- You must specify the number of vectors to be created
- You must enter the number of elements of each of the vectors.

The program will report through the console the time it took to print each of the vectors, and once the execution of the program has finished (that is, all the vectors are ordered), the results will be saved in a .txt file.
